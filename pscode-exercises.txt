// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

remainder = n % 2
IF remainder is not equal to 0
answer = odd
ELSE.
answer = even
print answer

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

input Array[num1, num2, num3, num4, num5]
num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5 = sum
average = sum/5
print average 
print "The average is the numbers added up and divided by how many numbers there are."

min(num1, num2, num3, num4, num5)
print min
print "The minimum is the smallest value of the data set."

max(num1, num2, num3, num4, num5)
print max
print "The maximum is the largest value of the data set."
